# NewYorkTimes-telegramBOT



* Telegram Channel : https://t.me/NYT_LiveUpdate 
 
 ---

Naive bot that check latest news on new york times journal and send them to a telegram channel (actually now just to my bot, I'm still testing and imporving it since there are a few behaviour that i dont' like --a few problems in live pages news). The goal is to create a telegram channel wtth this NYT news (just for fun, no profit) , simple, easy and interesting to keep everyone interested informed (maybe someone a lazy as me . ANYWAY THIS DESCRIPTION IS TOO LONG, I WILL EXPLAIN BETTER IN THE NEXT DAYS (+ i will also push the code for the bot, later also for the channel... see you later 😊

# Update 10 July 2022

 > The channel is still in test phase (actually the bot..). In within a week it will be fully working (live 24/7). Updates will follow, also based on users opinions   (gather by polls). 

# Update 29 June 2022
Attention : the instant preview option is only abvailable per smartphone users, it isn't implemented for the pc version of telegram...
You can still use it via pc but after some readings the NYT will ask you to buy a subscription to keep seeing the articles (the instant preview block that!)

And also with future modifications th bot will directly send titles and articles body through the bot (so no more links😁😁), solving the prev issue and live news issue (basically same since NO instant preview available !). 


# Update 27 June 2022

I uploaded the first scipt version. 
is not even close to be the final version. Here's why:
- for the moment it just send the link to the news. I would like to send directly a message with the article, and maybe allow for more languages (using google translator API, alredy tested for another project). But actually the "just link" solution is not that bad, since telegram open it in preview mode, so is possible to read all the news -wouldnt be possible in the NYT site/app (afer N article it requires a subscription if im not wrong...)
- i want to create a service on amazon / google cloud and make it "persistent"(?, maybe wrong word, lets say "let it go forever")
- then create a channel and use the bot to send message there, to spread informations/news for everyone

Now lets face the big question...WHY HAVE I DONE THE BOT ? (actually still doing)
Actually because Im courios about everything that is going on, the desire to do so is there, but every now and then I don't "want" to open the app / site (why precisely the NYT --> i believe is one of the best journal in the world, if not the best !)
So doing this bot it will send me all the news i'm interested in, without the need to search them + possibility to send just a summary of them/translate them (we can generalize by saying "preprocess them", which also include the possibility of translate them in diff languages and send them -obviously the text, not link anymore...)
